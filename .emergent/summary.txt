<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully migrated a PHP application onto an environment initially set up for React/FastAPI/MongoDB. This involved installing and configuring Apache and PHP, which required multiple attempts and troubleshooting of environment persistence issues. Key features implemented include a commission module, an enhanced authentication system (refactored from complex to simple), and a comprehensive enhanced inventory system for both tiles and other items. The inventory enhancements involved new database tables, advanced UI with sticky columns, search, photo uploads, QR code generation (initially with imagecreate() which failed, then switched to text-based, and directory issues resolved), cost breakdowns, and sales data integration. Currently, the engineer is addressing issues in the newly developed enhanced quotation and invoice modules, specifically fixing conversion to invoice, image display, update/delete, total calculation, and discount options.

<product_requirements>
The application is a business management system for a tile business. Initial requirements focused on:
1.  **Commission Module**: Calculate commission on final sale value (after discounts), with admin panel configuration and invoice display. (Implemented)
2.  **Inventory UI & Calculations**: Enhance UI for item updates/deletions and ensure accurate transport cost calculations. (Continuously enhanced)
3.  **Authentication & Access Control**: Manage users (Admin, Manager, Sales) with activation, page/field access control, password-based login, and session management. (Largely implemented and debugged)
4.  **Enhanced Inventory (Tiles & Other Items)**: Detailed purchase entries with damage calculations (simple percentage), as of cost logic, advanced UI (sticky columns, horizontal scroll, column picker, search), QR code generation (showing stock, price, image), single photo upload (max 3MB), and separate navigation for tiles and other items. (Significant implementation, currently being debugged/enhanced for sales data, cost breakdowns, and edit/delete functionality).
5.  **Quotations/Invoices Improvements**: Toggle calculation (sqft to boxes or direct box entry), stock availability warnings, mandatory customer name/mobile, optional customer GST/firm name, image display toggle, date range search for listings, total amount calculation, discount options, convert quotations to invoices, update/delete functionality, and a return/refund system (15-day limit, inventory/invoice reflection). (Initial implementation, currently being debugged for conversion, image toggle, update/delete, amount calculation, discounts, and returns).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging and enhancing the newly developed Enhanced Quotation and Invoice system. Immediately before this summary, the engineer addressed a critical file not found error by creating the missing  file, which is essential for the convert to invoice functionality. The next step identified is to fix the quotation update/delete functionality and ensure the total quotation amount is calculated and displayed correctly, as these were reported as not working or missing by the user. Other identified issues for this module include the image display toggle, missing discount options, and the development of a comprehensive return/refund system that integrates with inventory and invoices, including a 15-day return policy.
